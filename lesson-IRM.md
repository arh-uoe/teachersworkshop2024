# Activity: Incident Management & Response

## Activity Overview

In this activity students work through managing and responding to incidents using a set of pre-existing cards and scenarios. The cards are broken down into 3 categories;

•	Incident – A cyber security related attack or event, such as a network scan
•	Asset – A tool or security measure which helps mitigate incidents
•	Business Opportunity – A chance for players to earn more capital or reputation

Capital and reputation are the scoring system used in the game. Players pay capital to purchase assets. These can then allow them to have business opportunities. Reputation and capital are gained through business opportunities and lost through incidents. Incidents, if unmitigated, can also cause players to lose existing Business Opportunities. 

This activity requires the use of playing cards and can be played as a table top game or through provided tablets. The template to print cards off for the table top version is available from the associated GitHub Repo and some physical cards are also available to borrow. The code to play the game locally is available from the  GitHub Repo.

* [Fundamentals of cyber security (AQA)](https://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/computer-science-and-it/gcse/computer-science-8525/subject-content#Cyber_security)
* Incident Response Management

## Activity Setup

The following components support 1 group of 5 -6 students:
*	1 x Physical set of cards
  * Cards should be sorted into their 3 decks; Incidents, Assets and Business Opportunities
*	1 x Tablet / or machine running the provided code

Students can be organised into roles for the their group - This can help faciliate team build and an understanding of different roles within cyber security, roles can include;
* Head of Security
* Chief Technical Officer
* Accounts
* PR

Students could then be focused on the impact different choice might have on their role - For example if we buy data backups instead of SIEM we can't get a contract with FinTech. But we do risk Ransomware...

## Activity Exercises

Students are given a starting capital amount (75,000) and have 15 minutes to discuss with their group and decide how this is being spent. In the opening turn only starting assets (those with a green image border) can be purchased. Players may purchase multiple assets in the opening turn only. Once the 15 minutes is up (or all groups are happy) then each group draws their first incident card. 

If they can mitigate the incident then they are clear and can move onto a Business Opportunity. This will increase their capital and reputation and is applied immediately. 

If they can not fully mitigate the incident they must deal with the incident impact can not move onto a Business Opportunity. If they have existing Business Opportunities these must be checked to make sure that they don’t add additional impact based on the incident. For example by terminating the “contract” or by adding additional fee’s to be paid. Terminated contracts are considered lost and can not be regained. 

If players capital goes below 0 then they are overdrawn and are charged 10% of their overdrawn amount per turn. 

At the end of every turn players go into Asset Management. They can buy or sell 1 asset per turn. For example, they can buy the IPS and sell the IPS in the same turn. Players do not have to both buy and sell. They may choose.

## Activity Learning Outcomes

*	An understanding of different cyber security threats and mitigations
