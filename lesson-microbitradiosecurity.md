# Activity: A (micro)Bit of Radio Security

## Activity Overview

This activity requires at least 2x BBC micro:bits(v2) and a laptop with either python installed or an active internet connection (allowing use of the https://python.microbit.org/v/3).  

Students will use the micro:bits to communicate with each other via radio. Initial communication will be done as a broadcast and in plaintext. Students will then work through the use of pairing and “encrypted” communication. The exercise has been designed to cover the importance of secure communication and use of coding within cyber security. 

## Session Duration

45 minutes

* [Programming (AQA)](https://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/computer-science-and-it/gcse/computer-science-8525/subject-content#Programming)

* Secure Communications

## Activity Setup

The following components support 1 group of 2 – 4  students: 

* 1 x Laptop with either: 
  * Python3 installed 
  * Internet connection 
* 2 x micro:bit(v2) 
* 1 x micro:bit(v2) - For the teaching staff 

## Activity Exercises

Students will be given micro:bits in and use them to communicate with each other in their groups. In the initial stage as all micro:bits will be set to the same radio config any messages will be sent and received by any micro:bit within range.  

Students and teachers should discuss the issues with this approach before introducing the use of pairing. At this stage the micro:bits will no longer be sending messages on broadcast, but if another micro:bit were to join the same radio group they could still read the messages. This can be demonstrated by having the teaching staff micro:bit “eavesdrop” on a paired group. 

In the final phase the micro:bits will use pairing and encryption. This will now prevent the teaching staff from being able to listen in on the communication.  

## Activity Learning Outcomes

* An understanding of secure v insecure communication
* An understanding of high level programming
* An understanding of secure coding for cyber security
